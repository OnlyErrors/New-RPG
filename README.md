# Webpack JS New Test RPG
Node is Installed

Prerequisites
* Node

## Installation
If you don't already, install Node.js on your system <https://nodejs.org/>.
Then install Yarn, because that is what I happen to be using

In your system terminal run:
```
npm i -g yarn
```

Once yarn is installed, check that it is installed by running:
```
yarn --version
```

This template works with v1.9.4

Finally, install the dependencies by running:
```
yarn install
```

To build the deployment project run:
```
yarn build
```

To start the dev server on port 3000 run:
```
yarn start
```
